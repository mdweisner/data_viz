## Getting Started with GGPlot2

### Data Growth

If we take all the data between the beginning of time and 2008, we'll soon create that amount every minute.

So it's important we capture it!

## Methods of Capturing Data Trends:

### Modeling
Modeling is one way to understand relationships in data.

### Graphing / Visualization
This let's us quickly understand data in a more easily digestible way
Can also be good for digesting live-streaming data!

## Visualization
"Action or fact of visualization; the power or process of forming a mental picture or vision of something not present to the sight."

## Types of Visualization

1. To Understand/Discover Patterns (find things that rows don't reveal)
2. To Analyze (like seeing train slowdowns)
3. To Present (to make our point)
